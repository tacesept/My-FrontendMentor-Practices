          <p>
            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
            body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
            determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point
            to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
            Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
            health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

          <h3>Healthy eating</h3>
          <p>
            Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better
            digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

            Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and
            reduces disease risk, fostering wellness and longevity.

          <h3>Adequate sleep</h3>

        <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>
          Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
          not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider
          their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
          beneficial to use.

              <img src="./assets/images/icon-gender.svg" alt="gender" />
              <h3>Gender</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
              with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
              when evaluating their BMI.

              <h3>Age</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
              BMI to underestimate body fat content.

            <div>

              <h3>Muscle</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Muscle BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or
              obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
            </p>

              <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
              baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to
              minimise health risks for both mother and child.

            <p>
              Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and
              Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is
              advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
