### Responsive Layout
The website uses CSS Grid for a flexible and responsive layout. The grid system is implemented to:

- Ensure content reflow on different screen sizes
- Provide consistent gutters between grid items

### Mobile Navigation
The site features a hamburger menu for mobile devices that:
- Appears on screens below 768px width
- Toggles a sliding navigation menu
- Includes smooth transitions for better UX
- Uses JavaScript for interaction handling
- Maintains accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
